To solve these tasks  first i have to remember c++ coding syntax because i learn it one year before.
Then i learn XOR operators from youtube to solve the first problem because i never use it.
To solve this task i learn more about strings because problem 4 and 5 are all depends on strings.
Basically i spend more time on logic finding than coding to solve these problems beacuse once you find the logic then you can easily write code and modify it.
I learn more abour array's and methods of handling it that how to convert a string into character array.
