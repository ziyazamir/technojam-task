In this application you have a text box where you can write your paragraph and in the bottom of text box you can see LIVE that how many words and characters you write till now.
This application gives you the live count of words and characters withouth including space.
In this task when i think I have to show the live numbers of character then i stuck at a point that how i capture the spacebar and backspace because there is no any event in javascript and jquery
then i learn that every key has a unique code which i can use to solve it.
